== Scripture Study Assistant
This little app runs on Ruby on Rails 2.3.2 and is designed to help a Gospel Scholar
plan and execute a systematic and topical study of the Holy Scriptures.
The application includes a DB schema and data for the entire Standard Works of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. This explains the 10M size of the
git clone. 


== Getting Started

1. Once you have cloned the repo or unpacked the archive, you have a working rails application.
2. Edit configuration/databases.yml to reflect your DB server settings
3. From the root folder of the app, type rake db:migrate to create the schema. No data is loaded
4. If you want to populate the DB with the scriptures, type rake db:seed
5. Start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)
6. Go to http://localhost:3000/topics
7. More to come

== Testing
You can run the unit tests by typing rake tests:unit
